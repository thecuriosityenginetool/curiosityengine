Core Permission Model Implementation

1. Organization Hierarchy Levels
- Super Admin: System-wide access and configuration
- Organization Admin: Company-wide settings and member management  
- Team Lead: Department/team-level permissions
- Member: Basic access with inherited permissions

2. Content Sharing Rules
File: apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/permissions.ts
- Organization-wide material visibility
- Team-specific document access
- Personal workspace isolation
- Automatic inheritance of parent context
- Override capabilities based on role

3. Context Inheritance System
- Organization context flows down to all members
- Team context inherits from organization but can override
- Personal context merges with inherited settings
- Priority order: Personal > Team > Organization > Global

4. Permission Scopes
- Document access: View/Edit/Share/Delete
- Team management: Invite/Remove/Modify
- Integration configuration: Connect/Disconnect services
- Analytics visibility: Individual/Team/Organization

5. Cross-Organization Controls
- Strict isolation between organizations
- Shared resource access management
- Multi-org user context handling
- Organization-specific integration tokens

Importance Score: 85/100

The permission system implements sophisticated hierarchical access control specifically designed for sales teams, with granular content sharing and context inheritance mechanisms.

# permission-hierarchy

The permission system implements a multi-level hierarchical access control model:

1. Organization Hierarchy (Importance: 95/100)
- Three-tier organization structure:
  - Enterprise (unlimited seats, custom permissions)
  - Team (5-25 seats, standard roles)
  - Individual (1-5 seats, basic roles)
- Custom permission templates per organization type
- Resource sharing controls at organization level

2. Role-Based Permissions (Importance: 90/100)
- Core roles:
  - super_admin: System-wide access
  - org_admin: Organization-wide control
  - member: Basic access rights
- Role inheritance chain enforces permission propagation
- Custom role templates for different organization types

3. Content Sharing Rules (Importance: 85/100)
Path: apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/sales-materials/route.ts
- Hierarchical content visibility:
  - Personal (user-level)
  - Team (group-level)
  - Organization (org-level)
- Permission inheritance based on organizational structure
- Cross-organization sharing controls

4. Integration Permissions (Importance: 80/100)
Path: apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/integrations/status/route.ts
- Organization-level integration management
- User-specific integration tokens within org context
- Hierarchical token management system
- Multi-user integration configuration

5. Seat Management (Importance: 75/100)
Path: apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/invitations/route.ts
- Enforces organization-specific seat limits
- Manages user invitation workflows
- Handles role assignment during user onboarding
- Tracks seat usage and availability
