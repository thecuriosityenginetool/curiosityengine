# permission-hierarchy

Core Permission Model Implementation

1. Organization Hierarchy Levels
- Super Admin: System-wide access and configuration
- Organization Admin: Company-wide settings and member management  
- Team Lead: Department/team-level permissions
- Member: Basic access with inherited permissions

2. Content Sharing Rules
File: apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/permissions.ts
- Organization-wide material visibility
- Team-specific document access
- Personal workspace isolation
- Automatic inheritance of parent context
- Override capabilities based on role

3. Context Inheritance System
- Organization context flows down to all members
- Team context inherits from organization but can override
- Personal context merges with inherited settings
- Priority order: Personal > Team > Organization > Global

4. Permission Scopes
- Document access: View/Edit/Share/Delete
- Team management: Invite/Remove/Modify
- Integration configuration: Connect/Disconnect services
- Analytics visibility: Individual/Team/Organization

5. Cross-Organization Controls
- Strict isolation between organizations
- Shared resource access management
- Multi-org user context handling
- Organization-specific integration tokens
