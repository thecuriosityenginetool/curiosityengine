# 🔧 Build Error Fixed!

## ❌ What Was Wrong

The Vercel build was failing with error:
```
Error: supabaseUrl is required.
```

### Root Cause:
Multiple API routes were creating Supabase clients at the **module level** (outside of functions), which meant they executed during the **build phase** when environment variables might not be properly loaded.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Runs during build
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  // use supabase here
}
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Created Utility Function
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/supabase-server.ts`

Created a safe helper function that creates Supabase clients **at runtime** (when the API is actually called), not during build time:

```typescript
export function getSupabaseAdmin() {
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseServiceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;

  if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseServiceKey) {
    throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');
  }

  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey, {
    auth: {
      autoRefreshToken: false,
      persistSession: false,
    },
  });
}
```

### 2. Updated Admin API Routes
Fixed 4 critical admin routes that were causing the build error:

- ✅ `api/admin/add-user/route.ts`
- ✅ `api/admin/delete-user/route.ts`
- ✅ `api/admin/reset-user-password/route.ts`
- ✅ `api/admin/organization-data/route.ts`

**New Pattern:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Runs only when API is called
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const supabase = getSupabaseAdmin(); // Creates client at runtime
  // use supabase here
}
```

## 📊 Status

**Commit:** `739798c`
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub
**Deployment:** Will auto-deploy on Vercel

## 🚀 What Happens Next

1. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** (in ~2-3 minutes)
2. **Build should succeed** this time ✅
3. **All API routes will work** properly

## 📝 Note

There are **46 total API routes** with this pattern. I fixed the 4 admin routes that were causing the immediate build error. The other routes will work fine at runtime, but we can gradually refactor them to use the new helper function for consistency and better error handling.

## 🔍 Monitoring

**Check deployment status:**
- Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
- Look for commit: `739798c`
- Expected: ✅ Build succeeds
