# 📅 Calendar & Email Integration Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Outlook Calendar Integration** ✅
- ✅ Calendar event fetching from Outlook via Microsoft Graph API
- ✅ Calendar scopes added to OAuth: `Calendars.Read` and `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- ✅ 🔄 Sync button with loading state in dashboard
- ✅ Automatic calendar refresh functionality
- ✅ Fallback to mock data if Outlook not connected

### 2. **Email Draft Integration** ✅
- ✅ AI can create email drafts in Outlook
- ✅ AI can send emails via Outlook
- ✅ Email tools integrated into chat API
- ✅ Streaming responses show tool execution progress

### 3. **AI Chat Tools** ✅
- ✅ **Salesforce Tools**: search, create lead, update records, add notes, create tasks
- ✅ **Outlook Tools**: create email drafts, send emails, create calendar events
- ✅ Tool execution indicators in chat UI
- ✅ Streaming responses with real-time feedback

## 🔧 Required Action: Reconnect Outlook

### Why?
The calendar sync isn't working because we just added new calendar permission scopes. Your existing Outlook token was created BEFORE these scopes existed, so it doesn't have permission to read your calendar.

### How to Fix:

#### Option 1: Via Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.curiosityengine.io/dashboard
2. Click **Integrations** tab
3. If Outlook shows as connected, you need to disconnect and reconnect:
   - We'll add a disconnect button soon, but for now use Option 2

#### Option 2: Via SQL (Quick Fix)
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `CHECK_OUTLOOK_CONNECTION.sql` to verify current status
3. If calendar scopes are missing, run `DISCONNECT_OUTLOOK.sql`
4. Go back to dashboard and click **Connect** for Outlook
5. Grant permissions (you'll see the new calendar scopes listed)
6. Test the 🔄 Sync button

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

### Test Calendar Sync:
- [ ] Run `CHECK_OUTLOOK_CONNECTION.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify scopes include `Calendars.Read` and `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- [ ] Click 🔄 Sync button in dashboard calendar section
- [ ] Check browser console for: `📅 Fetching calendar events from Outlook...`
- [ ] Verify events appear (or mock data if no Outlook events exist)

### Test Email Draft Generation:
- [ ] Ensure Outlook is connected with full permissions
- [ ] Open AI chat in dashboard
- [ ] Try: "Create an email draft to john@example.com about our product demo"
- [ ] Check for success message in chat
- [ ] Verify draft appears in Outlook drafts folder

### Test Calendar Event Creation:
- [ ] In AI chat, try: "Create a meeting with Jane tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour"
- [ ] Check for success message
- [ ] Verify event appears in Outlook calendar

### Test Combined Workflow:
- [ ] Ask: "What's on my calendar tomorrow?"
- [ ] AI should show calendar events + match to Salesforce contacts (if any)
- [ ] Ask: "Create a follow-up email for tomorrow's meeting"
- [ ] AI should reference the meeting and create appropriate draft

## 📊 Database Status

### No Supabase Changes Needed! ✅

All required database tables and structures are already in place:
- ✅ `organization_integrations` - Stores OAuth tokens
- ✅ `users` - User accounts with organization links
- ✅ `chats` and `chat_messages` - Chat history
- ✅ `activity_logs` - Integration activity tracking

### Integration Types in Database:
- `outlook_user` - Individual user Outlook connections
- `salesforce_user` - Individual user Salesforce connections

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Calendar Shows Mock Data
**Check:**
1. Outlook connected? (Integrations tab)
2. Calendar scopes present? (Run `CHECK_OUTLOOK_CONNECTION.sql`)
3. Browser console shows "Fetching calendar events from Outlook..."?

**Fix:** Reconnect Outlook with new scopes

### Email Drafts Fail
**Common Causes:**
1. Outlook not connected
2. Invalid email address format
3. Token expired

**Fix:**
1. Check connection status in Integrations tab
2. Ensure email address is valid
3. Reconnect Outlook if token expired

### 401 Unauthorized Errors
**Cause:** Expired or invalid token

**Fix:** Run `DISCONNECT_OUTLOOK.sql` then reconnect via dashboard

### OAuth Scopes Required:
```
openid
offline_access
Mail.Send
Mail.ReadWrite
User.Read
