# ðŸ“… Calendar & Email Fixes - COMPLETE!

## ðŸŽ¯ Problems Solved

### 1. Calendar Event Display âœ…
**Before:**
- Event descriptions cut off with dots: "Join online meeting ......................"
- Text overflow looked unprofessional
- Hard to read long descriptions

**After:**
- Clean 2-line truncation with `line-clamp-2`
- Professional appearance
- No more awkward ellipsis overflow

### 2. Email Draft Cleanliness âœ…
**Before:**
- Emails included meta-text: "Feel free to customize these suggestions..."
- AI instructions appeared in Outlook drafts
- Looked unprofessional and confusing

**After:**
- Clean, professional email messages only
- No meta-text or AI instructions
- Ready to send immediately

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes

### Calendar Event Display
```tsx
{event.description && (
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1 line-clamp-2">
    {event.description}
  </p>
)}
```

**Benefits:**
- Tailwind's `line-clamp-2` utility
- Shows first 2 lines with clean ellipsis
- No text overflow
- Maintains layout consistency

### Email Generation Prompt Update

**New Instructions:**
```
Write ONLY the email body - no instructions, no meta-text, no suggestions.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include phrases like:
- "Feel free to customize"
- "Here's the email"
- Any instructions

Start directly with greeting, end with signature.
```

### Content Cleanup Function

Added automatic cleanup before sending to Outlook:

```typescript
// Remove common AI meta-phrases
const metaPhrases = [
  /Feel free to customize.*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /Here'?s (a|the) (email|draft|message).*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /\*\*Follow-up Email (Draft Created|Overview).*?\*\*/gi,
  /I'?ve prepared.*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /You can find the draft.*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /Please review.*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /Let me know if.*?(\n|$)/gi,
  /^---\s*$/gm, // Standalone dividers
];

metaPhrases.forEach(phrase => {
  cleanedContent = cleanedContent.replace(phrase, '');
});
```

**Removes:**
- AI commentary
- Instructions to customize
- Meta-headers
- Standalone dividers
- Any "Here's the email" type text
