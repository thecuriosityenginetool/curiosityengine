# Debug Content Script Not Loading

## Your Extension IS Working!
- âœ… Extension installed
- âœ… Authentication working  
- âœ… Background script running

## The Problem
The content script isn't injecting into LinkedIn pages.

## Quick Test

### 1. Open DevTools on LinkedIn Page
With the LinkedIn profile page open:
1. Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for this message:
   ```
   âœ… Sales Curiosity content script loaded on: https://...
   ```

### 2. If You DON'T See That Message:

The content script didn't load. This happens when:
- You had the LinkedIn page open BEFORE loading the extension
- The page hasn't been refreshed since loading the extension

### 3. Fix It:

**Option A: Refresh the LinkedIn Page**
1. Just press `Cmd+R` or `Ctrl+R` 
2. Wait for page to fully load
3. Check console again for the load message
4. Try clicking "Analyze Profile"

**Option B: Close & Reopen LinkedIn Tab**
1. Close the LinkedIn tab completely
2. Open a NEW LinkedIn profile
3. Wait for it to load
4. Check console for load message
5. Try clicking "Analyze Profile"

### 4. Verify Content Script Is Injected:

In the Console tab on LinkedIn, type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('sales-curiosity-loaded')
```

If it returns `null`, the script didn't load.
If it returns `<div id="sales-curiosity-loaded">`, the script IS loaded!

### 5. Manual Test:

In the Console tab on LinkedIn, paste this:
```javascript
console.log('Test H1s:', document.querySelectorAll('h1').length);
```

You should see a number > 0. This proves we can access the DOM.

## The Real Fix

Content scripts only inject when the page loads. You must:

1. **Load the extension FIRST**
2. **THEN open LinkedIn pages**

Or:

1. **Refresh LinkedIn pages** after loading the extension

## What The Logs Tell Us

Your logs show:
```
background.ts:2 Sales Curiosity Extension installed
popup.tsx:58 ðŸ”µ Checking authentication...
```

These are from the EXTENSION context.

We need to see logs from the LINKEDIN PAGE context:
```
âœ… Sales Curiosity content script loaded on: https://www.linkedin.com/in/...
```

## Try This Right Now:

1. Keep the extension popup CLOSED
2. Go to the LinkedIn page
3. Press F12 (open DevTools)
4. Press Cmd+R (refresh the page)
5. Watch the Console tab
6. You should see "âœ… Sales Curiosity content script loaded"
7. If you see it, NOW click the extension icon
8. Click "Analyze Profile"
9. It should work!

The issue is: **The content script loads when the page loads, not when you click the extension.**
