# Debug Outlook Connection Issue

The OAuth flow redirects with success, but the connection check returns false. Here's how to diagnose:

## Step 1: Check Vercel Deployment Status

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com
2. Find your `curiosityengine` project
3. Check if the latest deployment (commit `86b25e5`) is live
   - Should show: "Fix Outlook OAuth callback - use maybeSingle()"
4. Wait for deployment to complete if still building

## Step 2: Check Vercel Server Logs

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Logs" tab (or Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Logs)
3. Try connecting Outlook again
4. Filter logs for `/api/outlook/user-callback`
5. Look for these logs (from our fix):
   ```
   üîµ Outlook callback received
   üîµ Parsed state: { userId: '...', organizationId: '...' }
   üîµ Exchanging code for tokens...
   ‚úÖ Tokens received
   üîµ Existing integration: Found/Not found
   ‚úÖ Integration created/updated successfully
   ```

**If you see errors**, copy them and we'll fix them.

## Step 3: Check Database State

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run the diagnostic script: `DIAGNOSE_OUTLOOK_CONNECTION.sql`
4. Update the email at the top: `v_user_email TEXT := 'your-email@example.com';`
5. Check the output:
   - Does it find your user?
   - Does it find an integration record?
   - Does your user ID have tokens in the configuration?

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue A: RLS Policy Blocking INSERT
**Symptom:** No integration record found in database
**Fix:** Update RLS policy to allow service role to insert

```sql
-- Check if service role can insert
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage integrations" 
ON organization_integrations 
FOR ALL 
TO service_role 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Issue B: User ID Mismatch
**Symptom:** Integration exists but different user ID in config
**Fix:** The state parameter has mismatched userId and organizationId

Check logs for:
```
üîµ Parsed state: { userId: '...', organizationId: '...' }
```

### Issue C: Microsoft OAuth Not Completing
**Symptom:** Callback never receives code
**Possible causes:**
- Redirect URI mismatch in Azure AD app
- User denied permissions
- Session expired

### Issue D: Token Exchange Failing
**Symptom:** Error in "Exchanging code for tokens"
**Possible causes:**
- Invalid Microsoft client credentials
- Redirect URI doesn't match Azure AD config

## Current State Analysis

From your console logs:
- ‚úÖ Auth URL generated correctly
- ‚úÖ Redirect to Microsoft successful
- ‚úÖ Redirect back with success message
- ‚ùå Status check returns `{connected: false}`

This suggests **the tokens are being saved but not retrieved**, or **RLS is blocking the read**.

## Next: Get Server Logs

The most important step is **Step 2** - we need to see the server-side logs to know:
1. Did the callback receive the authorization code?
2. Did token exchange succeed?
3. Did database insert/update succeed?
4. Were there any RLS errors?

Once you check the Vercel logs and run the diagnostic SQL, share the results and we'll fix the exact issue!
