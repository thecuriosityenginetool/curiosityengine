2. Select:
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files

3. Time range: "Last hour"
4. Click **"Clear data"**

### Step 4: Restart Chrome (Important!)

3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Reopen Chrome

### Step 5: Load Fresh Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`

   ```

   ```
5. Click **"Select"**

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Extension name: "Sales Curiosity"
- ‚úÖ New orange flame icon üî•

## üéØ Expected Result

The extension should:
1. Show "Analyzing..." loading state
2. Extract profile data successfully
3. Display AI-generated insights
4. No error messages!

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Extension Console
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find Sales Curiosity
3. Click "Inspect views: service worker"
4. Look for errors in console
5. Take a screenshot if there are errors

### Check 2: Page Console
1. On the LinkedIn profile page
2. Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for "Sales Curiosity content script loaded"
5. If you don't see this message, the content script didn't load

### Check 3: Permissions
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Details" on Sales Curiosity
3. Scroll to "Site access"
4. Should show: "On specific sites" 
5. Should list: linkedin.com

## üìù Why This Happens

Chrome extensions use **content scripts** that inject into web pages. When you:
- Update the extension
- Reload the extension
- Have pages already open

The old content script stays on those pages! You MUST:
1. Remove the extension completely
2. Close all tabs that used it
3. Restart Chrome
4. Load fresh extension
5. Open NEW tabs

## üöÄ Extension Location

```
/Users/matthewbravo/Downloads/curiosityengine-2/apps/sales-curiosity-extension/dist
```

Make sure you're loading the `/dist` folder, not `/src`!

## ‚ú® Latest Build Includes

- ‚úÖ New orange flame icon
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling
- ‚úÖ Better profile extraction
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages
- ‚úÖ All latest fixes

---

**Important:** After these steps, the extension WILL work. If you skip any step, especially closing tabs or restarting Chrome, the content script won't reload properly.

Follow every step in order! üéØ
