## üîß What Needs to Be Done BEFORE Buddy Tests

### Step 1: Clear Old Salesforce Test Data (CRITICAL!)

**You must run this in Supabase:**

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run this query:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM organization_integrations 
   WHERE integration_type IN ('salesforce', 'salesforce_user');
   ```
5. Click "Run"
6. ‚úÖ Old test connection cleared

**Why:** The web app is showing "‚úì Connected" because of old test data in the database. This clears it.

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel Deployment (3-5 minutes)

Check: https://vercel.com/deployments

**Look for these commits to show "Ready" ‚úÖ:**
- `8ed8bfe` - Fix extension token validation
- `1550b8b` - Salesforce auth-user accepts extension tokens
- `42de6be` - Salesforce success page
- `78b9a4b` - Temporary workaround
- `5402c1a` - LinkedIn extraction fix

**All 5 must be deployed!**

### Step 3: Give Buddy the Latest Extension

**Option A: From Website (After Vercel Deploys)**
1. Wait for Vercel
2. Buddy goes to: https://www.curiosityengine.io/install
3. Downloads ZIP
4. Installs

**Option B: Direct from Your Computer (Faster)**
1. Share this folder with buddy:
   `/Users/paulwallace/Desktop/sales-curiosity-engine/apps/sales-curiosity-extension/dist`
2. Buddy loads it as unpacked extension
