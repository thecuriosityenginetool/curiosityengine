# ✅ AI Context Saving - FIXED!

## ❌ The Problem:

**Context wasn't saving** because:
- Code tried to save to `public.users` table
- Table didn't exist!
- Only `auth.users` existed (Supabase auth table)
- `auth.users` doesn't support custom fields like `user_context`

## ✅ The Solution:

### 1. Created Custom Users Table

**New Table:** `public.users`

**Fields:**
- `id` - Links to auth.users (foreign key)
- `email` - User email (unique)
- `full_name` - Display name
- `job_title` - Your role
- `company_name` - Your company
- `company_url` - Company website
- `role` - member, org_admin, or super_admin
- `organization_id` - Team/organization
- **`user_context`** - JSONB field with `aboutMe` and `objectives` ✨
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

### 2. Migrated Existing Users

All 5 existing users migrated:
- ✅ matt@antimatterai.com
- ✅ paul@antimatterai.com  
- ✅ christian@owasp.com
- ✅ admin+chapters@owasp.test
- ✅ star@owasp.com

Each user now has:
```json
{
  "aboutMe": "",
  "objectives": ""
}
```

### 3. Added Security (RLS Policies)

**Row Level Security enabled:**
- Users can only read their own data
- Users can only update their own data
- Users can only insert their own data
- No cross-user data access

### 4. Performance Optimizations

**Indexes created:**
- `idx_users_email` - Fast email lookups
- `idx_users_organization_id` - Fast org queries

**Auto-update trigger:**
- `updated_at` automatically updates on changes

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Saving Context:

1. User fills in "About Me" and "My Objectives"
2. Clicks "Save Context"
3. API call to `/api/user/context` (PUT)
4. Updates `public.users.user_context` JSONB field
5. Success message shown

### AI Uses Context:

When you chat with AI, it receives:
```
YOUR PERSONAL CONTEXT:
{
  "aboutMe": "I'm a sales manager at Antimatter...",
  "objectives": "Close 5 enterprise deals this quarter..."
}
```

The AI then personalizes all responses based on:
- Your role and company
- Your personal background  
- Your sales objectives
- Your uploaded materials
- Your CRM data (if connected)

## 🚀 Test It Now:

1. Go to **Settings** tab (or Context in extension)
2. Fill in:
   - **About Me:** Describe your role, company, what you do
   - **My Objectives:** Your sales goals and targets
3. Click **"Save Context"**
4. Should see: "Context saved successfully!" ✅
5. Go back to chat and ask AI anything
6. AI will now personalize responses to YOU!

## 📊 What Gets Saved:

```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET user_context = {
  "aboutMe": "Your text here",
  "objectives": "Your goals here"
}
WHERE id = 'your-user-id';
```

## 🔒 Security:

- RLS ensures you only see your own context
- No other users can read your data
- API validates auth tokens
- JSONB field allows flexible structure

## ✨ Result:

**Before:** Generic AI responses  
**After:** AI that knows:
- Who you are
- What you sell
- Your company
- Your goals
- Your materials

**Personalized, branded, on-message responses!** 🎉
