# CRITICAL STATUS - Auth & Data Loading Issues

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES - Need Immediate Fix

---

## üî¥ CURRENT STATE (From Console Logs)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Signup creates users in database
- Login creates Supabase session
- @supabase/ssr installed and working
- Sessions persist (after multiple refreshes)
- Dashboard pages render

### What's Broken ‚ùå
1. **Login requires 4+ hard refreshes**
2. **Org dashboard requires 4+ more hard refreshes**
3. **Users tab shows 0 users** (but users exist in database!)
4. **Logout doesn't work** (stays on same page)
5. **Multiple 500 Internal Server Errors** on API calls
6. **Data queries return empty arrays** even though data exists

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### From Console Logs:
```
‚úÖ Org data set, showing dashboard
Loading users/analyses/emails...
Loading organization data for: f12288ff-6d92-4c5b-b639-e9c660466665

‚ùå GET /rest/v1/organization_integrations 500 (Internal Server Error)
‚ùå GET /rest/v1/linkedin_analyses 500 (Internal Server Error)
‚ùå GET /rest/v1/users 500 (Internal Server Error)  
‚ùå GET /rest/v1/email_generations 500 (Internal Server Error)

‚úÖ Data loaded: {users: 0, analyses: 0, emails: 0}
Users: []
```

**THE PROBLEM:** All Supabase queries are returning 500 errors!

**WHY:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies are TOO STRICT or BROKEN

---

## üõ†Ô∏è THE FIX

### Option 1: Disable RLS Temporarily (Quick Test)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS to test
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.linkedin_analyses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_generations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.organization_integrations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Then test:** Users should appear immediately!

**If this works:** We know RLS policies are the problem.

### Option 2: Fix RLS Policies (Proper Solution)

The issue is likely that the client-side queries don't have proper auth context.

**Current approach:** Client calls Supabase directly  
**Problem:** RLS can't see `auth.uid()` from client queries

**Solution:** Use APIs with service role key for ALL org dashboard data

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### 1. Test if RLS is the problem:
```
1. Disable RLS (SQL above)
2. Refresh org dashboard
3. Do users appear?
4. YES ‚Üí RLS is the problem
5. NO ‚Üí Something else is wrong
```

### 2. Check if users are in correct organization:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.role,
  u.organization_id,
  o.name as org_name
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.organizations o ON u.organization_id = o.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;
```

**Check:** Do all users have the SAME organization_id?

### 3. Fix Logout:
The logout isn't working because `window.location.replace('/')` might not be triggering.

**Try:**
```typescript
await supabase.auth.signOut();
// Force a HARD reload
window.location.href = '/?_=' + Date.now(); // Cache busting
```

## üìä WHAT I SEE IN YOUR SCREENSHOTS

**Screenshot 3 (Org Dashboard - Users Tab):**
```
Total users: 0 | Filtered: 0 | Search: ""
No users found. Click "+ Add User" to create team members.
```

**This confirms:** The `users` array is completely empty!

**But we created users!** So they're either:
- In a different organization
- Being blocked by RLS
- Not actually created

**Screenshot 4 (Logged in as yasmine - Member):**
```
Session: EXISTS yasmine@antimatterai.com
‚úÖ Auth state: AUTHENTICATED
User data: {...role: 'member', organizations: {...}}
‚úÖ Full user data loaded! Role: member Type: organization
```

**This works!** So regular users CAN load data.

**Why org admins can't?** Different RLS policies or API endpoint issues.

---

## üí° RECOMMENDED APPROACH

Since we're deep in debugging mode, let's take a systematic approach:

### Step 1: Verify Data Exists
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM public.users;
SELECT count(*) FROM public.organizations;
SELECT email, role, organization_id FROM public.users;
```

Send me the results.

### Step 2: Test Without RLS
Temporarily disable RLS and see if data loads.

### Step 3: If RLS is the problem
Create API endpoints for org dashboard that use service role:
- `/api/admin/users` - Get all org users
- `/api/admin/analyses` - Get all org analyses
- `/api/admin/emails` - Get all org emails

This way RLS doesn't block anything.

## üÜò WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

**Option A: Quick Test (5 minutes)**
1. Run SQL to disable RLS
2. Refresh org dashboard
3. Tell me if users appear

**Option B: Check Database (2 minutes)**
1. Run SQL to see all users
2. Check if organization_ids match
3. Send me the results

**Option C: Let me rebuild from scratch (30 minutes)**
I can create a clean, simple version that definitely works, but we'll lose some of today's changes.

---

**Which option do you want to try first?**

I recommend Option A (disable RLS test) - it's the fastest way to confirm the problem.
