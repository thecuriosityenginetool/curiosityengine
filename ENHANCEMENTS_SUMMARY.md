## 💡 Key Insights

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Integration Display Logic
```
Individual User:
  → Shows "Coming Soon" buttons (their workspace, will have control)

Org Admin:
  → Shows link to dashboard (manages there, not in extension)

Org Member:
  → Shows status only (transparent but no confusing buttons)
```

### Context Syncing
- Saves to **both** local storage (fast) and database (persistent)
- Org admins can see member context in dashboard
- Helps with team coordination
- Auto-syncs on every save

### Stats Loading
- Loads after auth check
- Updates when new analysis/email created
- Team stats only for org admins
- Recent analyses show last 3
