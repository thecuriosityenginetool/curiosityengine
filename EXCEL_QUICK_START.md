## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ Do This
- **Use clear headers** in first row (Product Name, Price, SKU)
- **Keep data organized** (one table per sheet)
- **Name sheets descriptively** (Products, Pricing, not Sheet1)
- **Remove empty rows** between data
- **Test with small file first** (100 rows)

### ❌ Avoid This
- Don't merge cells
- Don't use password protection
- Don't scatter data across sheet
- Don't use very complex formulas
- Don't upload >50MB files
