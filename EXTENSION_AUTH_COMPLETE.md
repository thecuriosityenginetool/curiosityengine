# 🎉 Extension OAuth Authentication - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The extension now has **fully automated OAuth authentication** that works seamlessly!

### The Problem:
- Extension opened login page
- User logged in with OAuth
- Extension didn't receive auth token
- User saw dashboard but extension stayed logged out

### The Solution:
Created an **auth bridge** using content scripts and postMessage:

```
Extension → Opens /login?extension=true
     ↓
User logs in with Google/Microsoft
     ↓
Redirected to /extension-auth page
     ↓
Page calls /api/extension/oauth-auth → Gets token
     ↓
Page sends postMessage with token
     ↓
Auth-bridge content script receives message
     ↓
Stores token in chrome.storage.local
     ↓
Extension detects token → User logged in! ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### postMessage Communication:
```typescript
// Web page (extension-auth) sends:
window.postMessage({
  type: 'EXTENSION_AUTH',
  authToken: 'base64token...',
  user: { id, email, fullName, role }
}, window.location.origin);

// Extension (auth-bridge.ts) receives:
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'EXTENSION_AUTH') {
    chrome.storage.local.set({
      authToken: event.data.authToken,
      user: event.data.user
    });
  }
});
```

### Security:
- ✅ Origin checking (only accepts from curiosityengine.io)
- ✅ Message type validation
- ✅ Token stored securely in chrome.storage
- ✅ No token exposure in URLs or console

## 🎨 UI Updates

### OAuth Login Screen:
- ✨ Google button with logo
- ✨ Microsoft button with logo
