# Chrome Extension Update - New Features

## Overview
The Sales Curiosity Chrome Extension has been significantly enhanced with a multi-page architecture, user context management, and email drafting capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. Navigation Menu
- **Three main pages**: Home, Context, and Integrations
- Clean tab-based navigation at the top of the popup
- Icon-based navigation with visual feedback

### 2. Context Page
Users can now save personal information that will be used to personalize all AI interactions:
- **About Me**: Describe role, company, and expertise
- **My Objectives**: Define sales goals and what they want to achieve
- Context is saved locally in Chrome storage
- Automatically loaded on authentication

### 3. Enhanced Home Page
Instead of just "Analyze Profile", users now have two options:

#### Option A: Analyze Profile
- Traditional profile analysis with AI insights
- Uses user context to personalize the analysis
- Provides executive summary, key insights, sales angles, pain points, and conversation starters

#### Option B: Draft Email
- NEW: Generate a personalized outreach email
- Optional email-specific context field where users can add:
  - Specific approach for the email
  - Key points to mention
  - Tone preferences
  - Any special instructions
- Combines both general user context AND email-specific context
- AI generates complete email with subject line and body

### 4. Integrations Page
Placeholder page for future integrations:
- **Email Integration**: Gmail, Outlook, etc. (Coming Soon)
- **CRM Integration**: Salesforce, HubSpot, etc. (Coming Soon)
- Professional UI with "Coming Soon" badges

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (popup.tsx)
- Added TypeScript types: `Page`, `ActionType`, `UserContext`
- New state management for:
  - Current page navigation
  - Action type (analyze vs email)
  - Email-specific context
  - User context (aboutMe, objectives)
- Three render functions:
  - `renderHomePage()` - Main analysis and email drafting interface
  - `renderContextPage()` - User profile management
  - `renderIntegrationsPage()` - Future integration placeholders
- Context saved to `chrome.storage.local`

### Backend Changes (prospects/route.ts)
- Accepts new parameters:
  - `action`: "analyze" or "email"
  - `userContext`: Object with aboutMe and objectives
  - `emailContext`: Optional email-specific instructions
- Dynamic prompt generation based on action type:
  - Analysis prompt: Comprehensive profile analysis
  - Email prompt: Professional email drafting with specific formatting
- Mock responses updated to handle both action types
- Real OpenAI integration supports both workflows

### Data Flow
1. User fills in Context page (one-time setup)
2. User navigates to LinkedIn profile
3. User chooses "Analyze Profile" or "Draft Email"
4. If email: User optionally adds email-specific context
5. Extension sends to API with:
   - Profile data (from LinkedIn scraping)
   - User context (from Context page)
   - Email context (if drafting email)
   - Action type
6. API generates appropriate response
7. Results displayed in extension with export options

## User Experience Improvements
- Clear separation of concerns across pages
- Progressive disclosure (context is optional but recommended)
- Email drafting flow guides users step-by-step
- Cancel buttons at each step
- Visual feedback with loading states
- Consistent design language throughout

## Future Enhancements
- Email integration to send directly from extension
- CRM integration to save contacts automatically
- Email template library
- A/B testing for email subject lines
- Response tracking and analytics
