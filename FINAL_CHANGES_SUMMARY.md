## 📱 Extension vs Mobile Question Answered

### **Chrome Extensions DON'T Work on Mobile** ⚠️

**Reality:**
- Chrome extensions ONLY work on desktop Chrome
- Android Chrome: ❌ No extensions
- iOS Chrome: ❌ No extensions
- Safari mobile: ❌ Different system entirely

**Solution:**
- ✅ Web app is fully mobile responsive
- ✅ Mobile users can use ALL features via web browser
- ✅ Desktop users get extension for convenience
- ✅ Everyone can analyze LinkedIn profiles!

**Your Approach:**
- Desktop = Extension (auto-detect LinkedIn pages)
- Mobile = Web App (enter LinkedIn URLs manually)
- Both = Full functionality, great UX!
