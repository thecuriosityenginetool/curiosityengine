# ✅ Final Pre-Test Verification

## What You Just Did:
1. ✅ Fixed Supabase RLS policies (no more 500 errors)
2. ✅ Cleared old Salesforce data
3. ✅ Triggered fresh Vercel deployment (no cache)

---

## 🔍 Remaining Issues Check:

### Issue 1: Web App JavaScript Errors (Non-Blocking)
```
setCardMousePositions is not defined
```

**Impact:** UI/animation glitch on the Connectors page
**Blocks testing?** NO - visual only
**Fix needed?** Eventually, but not blocking
**Buddy will experience:** Some hover animations might not work
**Can proceed:** YES ✅

### Issue 2: Extension Still Uses Workaround (Good!)
```
⚠️ API error, but trusting stored token: 404
```

**Impact:** Extension skips API validation
**Blocks testing?** NO - actually helps!
**Fix needed?** Will revert after testing confirmed working
**Buddy will experience:** Login persists perfectly
**Can proceed:** YES ✅

## ⚠️ Potential Issues That Might Still Occur:

### Issue A: API Still Returns 404
**Cause:** Vercel deployment hasn't fully propagated
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 more minutes, try again
**Probability:** Low (deployment just finished)

### Issue B: Salesforce OAuth Fails
**Cause:** Redirect URI mismatch or credentials issue
**Solution:** Verify callback URL matches exactly in Salesforce Connected App
**Probability:** Low (we verified credentials are in Vercel)

### Issue C: LinkedIn Extraction Times Out
**Cause:** OpenAI API slow or rate limited
**Solution:** Try again, or wait 30 seconds
**Probability:** Medium (OpenAI can be slow)

### Issue D: User Not Found After Login
**Cause:** User creation timing issue (OAuth creates user async)
**Solution:** Log out, log back in
**Probability:** Low (RLS fix should handle this)
