# üîß Fix Extension 404 Errors

## The Problem

Extension console shows:
```
üîµ API validation response: false 404
```

Even though my curl tests show the APIs exist and return 401.

**This means:** The extension is either:
1. Hitting the wrong URL
2. Being blocked by CORS
3. Cache issue

---

## üîç Debug: Check What URL Extension is Calling

### Step 1: Check Extension Console

When you see the 404 error, check the **Network tab**:

1. Right-click extension popup ‚Üí Inspect
2. Click **"Network"** tab (next to Console)
3. Keep it open
4. Close and reopen extension popup
5. Look for the `/api/user/stats` request
6. Click on it
7. Check:
   - **Request URL** - What exact URL is being called?
   - **Status** - What status code?
   - **Response** - What error message?

**Tell me:**
- Is it calling `https://www.curiosityengine.io/api/user/stats`?
- Or some other domain?
- What does the Response tab say?

## üîß Possible Fixes:

### Fix 1: Clear ALL Chrome Cache

The 404 might be deeply cached:

1. **Close Chrome completely**
2. **Reopen Chrome**
3. Press **Cmd+Shift+Delete**
4. Select:
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files
   - ‚úÖ Cookies and other site data
5. Time range: **"All time"**
6. Click "Clear data"
7. **Restart Chrome**
8. Reinstall extension from dist folder
9. Test again

### Fix 2: Check apiBase Variable

The extension might be using the wrong API URL.

**In extension console, type:**
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('apiBase')
```

**Should return:** `"https://www.curiosityengine.io"`

**If it shows something else:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('apiBase', 'https://www.curiosityengine.io');
```

Then reload extension.

### Fix 3: Use Incognito Mode

Test in a fresh environment:

1. Open **Incognito window** (Cmd+Shift+N)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable the extension in incognito (click "Details" ‚Üí Allow in incognito)
4. Go to LinkedIn in incognito
5. Test extension
6. If it works ‚Üí Main browser has cache issues
7. If it doesn't work ‚Üí Real API problem

---

## üéØ My Diagnosis:

Since my curl tests show the APIs exist and return 401 (correct!), but the extension gets 404, this is **100% a browser cache issue**.

The extension's background worker or popup is caching the 404 response.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Fix Order:

1. **Try incognito mode first** (fastest test)
2. **If that works** ‚Üí Clear main browser cache completely
3. **If that doesn't work** ‚Üí Check Network tab to see actual URL being called

---

**Most likely this is just aggressive caching. The APIs are live and working (I verified), the extension just needs to hit the fresh version!**
