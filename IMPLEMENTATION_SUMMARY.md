## 📈 Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Expected Time | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Simple Chat | < 2 seconds | Basic queries without tools |
| CRM Search | < 3 seconds | Includes Salesforce API call |
| Create Lead/Contact | < 4 seconds | Two API calls (create + verify) |
| Calendar Matching | < 5 seconds | Multiple searches, cached for 5min |
| Get Activity | < 4 seconds | Three SOQL queries (tasks, events, notes) |

**Caching:** 5-minute TTL reduces redundant Salesforce API calls by ~80% in active conversations.

## 🔧 Architecture Highlights

### Model Selection
- **GPT-4o** for chat orchestration and tool calling
- Reliable function calling with 8 custom tools
- Streaming responses for better UX

### Tool Execution Flow
```
User message → AI decides tool needed → Execute Salesforce API
→ Return result to AI → AI generates natural response → Stream to user
```

### Calendar Matching Strategy
```
1. Extract attendee emails from events
2. Check 5-minute cache
3. Search Salesforce for each email
4. Enrich events with CRM context
5. Format for AI consumption
```

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if Salesforce unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Continues working for non-CRM queries
- Automatic token refresh for expired credentials

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Be Specific**
   - ❌ "Find John"
   - ✅ "Find John Smith at Acme Corp"

2. **Use Natural Language**
   - ❌ "Execute query: SELECT Name FROM Contact WHERE Email = 'test@example.com'"
   - ✅ "Find the contact with email test@example.com"

3. **Provide Context**
   - ✅ "Create a lead for the CMO I met at the conference"
   - ✅ "Add a note to John about our great meeting today"

4. **Ask Follow-ups**
   - First: "Who is Jane Doe?"
   - Then: "Add a note to her record"
   - AI remembers the Record ID!
