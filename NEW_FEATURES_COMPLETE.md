# üéâ New Features Complete!

## ‚úÖ Feature 1: Persistent Analysis Storage

**What it does:** Analysis results now stay loaded when you navigate away and come back!

**How it works:**
- When you analyze a LinkedIn profile, the result is saved to Chrome local storage
- Extension remembers the URL of the analyzed profile
- If you close the extension and reopen it on the same LinkedIn profile, the analysis automatically loads
- No need to re-analyze the same person!

**Technical:**
- Saves to `chrome.storage.local`: `lastAnalysis`, `lastAnalysisUrl`, `lastProfileData`
- Loads automatically in `useEffect` when extension opens
- Compares current URL with saved URL

## ‚úÖ Feature 2: Auto-Open Extension (Limitation)

**Chrome Security Restriction:**
Chrome doesn't allow extensions to auto-open their popups for security reasons. This is a browser limitation, not our code.

**Why?** To prevent malicious extensions from spamming users with popups.

**Workaround:** Users simply click the extension icon when on a LinkedIn profile page.

**Reference:** [Chrome Extension API Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/)
