# Organization Features Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive organization account features added to the Sales Curiosity Engine. Organizations can now manage teams, control integrations, and view all user activities from a centralized admin dashboard.

---

## üéØ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements

#### New Tables Created:
- **`organizations`** - Stores organization information
- **`email_generations`** - Tracks all generated emails by users
- **`organization_integrations`** - Controls which integrations are enabled per org
- **`user_invitations`** - Manages user invitation system
- **`audit_logs`** - Tracks important actions within organizations

#### Updated Tables:
- **`users`** - Added `organization_id`, changed `is_admin` to `role` field (super_admin, org_admin, member)
- **`linkedin_analyses`** - Added `organization_id` for easier querying

#### Key Features:
- Multi-tenant architecture with row-level security (RLS)
- Automatic organization creation on signup
- User roles: super_admin, org_admin, member
- Seat limits per organization
- User context storage (aboutMe, objectives)

### 2. Signup Flow Updates

#### Account Type Selection:
Users can now choose between:
- **Individual Account** üë§ - For personal use
- **Organization Account** üè¢ - For teams & companies

#### What Happens on Signup:
1. **Individual Accounts:**
   - Creates a personal organization (named "{Full Name}'s Workspace")
   - User is assigned as 'member' role
   - Seat limit: 10 (default)

2. **Organization Accounts:**
   - Creates a new organization with provided name
   - First user becomes 'org_admin' automatically
   - Can invite additional users
   - Seat limit: 10 (default, configurable)

### 3. Organization Admin Dashboard

**Location:** `/admin/organization/page.tsx`

#### Features:

**Overview Tab:**
- Total users vs. seat capacity
- Total profile analyses
- Total emails generated
- Active integrations count
- Recent activity summary (24hr stats)

**Users Tab:**
- View all users in organization
- See user roles (Admin/Member badges)
- View user status (Active/Inactive)
- Click to expand and see user context (aboutMe, objectives)
- User activity stats (analyses, emails)
- Invite new users button

**Analyses Tab:**
- View all LinkedIn profile analyses by all users
- See who created each analysis
- Filter and search profiles
- Direct links to LinkedIn profiles

**Emails Tab:**
- View all generated emails by all users

- Track who generated each email
- Search functionality

**Integrations Tab:**

### 4. Email Generation Tracking

**Location:** `/api/prospects/route.ts`

#### What's Tracked:
- User who generated the email
- Organization ID
- LinkedIn URL and profile name
- Email subject and body
- Email-specific context/instructions
- Timestamp

#### Automatic Parsing:
The system automatically parses the AI-generated email to extract:
- Subject line
- Body content (with formatting)

### 5. Security & Multi-Tenancy

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:

**Users can:**
- View their own data
- View other members of their organization
- Update their own profile

**Org Admins can:**
- View all users in their organization
- Manage users (create, update, deactivate)
- View all analyses in their organization
- View all email generations in their organization
- Manage organization integrations
- Send user invitations

**Data Isolation:**
- Each organization's data is completely isolated
- RLS policies enforce access control at database level
- Users can only access data from their organization

### 6. Helper Functions

**SQL Functions Created:**
- `handle_new_user()` - Automatically creates user + organization on signup
- `log_audit_event()` - Logs important actions for audit trail
- `user_has_role()` - Checks user permissions
- `get_user_organization_id()` - Gets user's organization ID

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Things You Might Have Missed (That We Included!)

1. **Audit Logging** - Track all important actions for compliance
2. **User Context Storage** - Store aboutMe and objectives from extension
3. **Email Context Tracking** - Save the specific instructions users provide for emails
4. **Seat Limits** - Prevent organizations from exceeding their plan
5. **User Invitation System** - Complete database structure ready
6. **Integration Configuration** - Store API keys and OAuth tokens securely
7. **Inactive User Handling** - Ability to deactivate users without deleting
8. **Organization Settings JSONB** - Flexible field for future custom settings
9. **Multi-tenant Indexes** - Performance optimized for organization queries
10. **Graceful Degradation** - System still works if database save fails

### Additional Considerations

#### Data Privacy & GDPR
- User data is isolated by organization
- Org admins can view team data (disclosed in ToS)
- Individual accounts keep data private
- Need to add data export/deletion capabilities

#### Performance
- Indexes on organization_id for all relevant tables
- RLS policies use indexes for performance
- Consider pagination for large organizations

#### Scalability
- Multi-tenant architecture supports unlimited organizations
- Row-level security enforced at database level
- Vertical scaling supported by Supabase

#### Security
- RLS policies enforce access control
- Service role key only used server-side
- Auth tokens validated on every request
- Invitation tokens are UUIDs with expiry

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Database Migration
```sql
-- Run the new schema file in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase-schema-organizations.sql
```

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Users (If Any)
```sql
-- If you have existing users, run this migration
DO $$
DECLARE
  user_record RECORD;
  new_org_id UUID;
BEGIN
  FOR user_record IN SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE organization_id IS NULL LOOP
    INSERT INTO public.organizations (name, account_type)
    VALUES (COALESCE(user_record.full_name, user_record.email) || '''s Workspace', 'individual')
    RETURNING id INTO new_org_id;
    
    UPDATE public.users 
    SET organization_id = new_org_id,
        role = CASE 
          WHEN is_admin THEN 'super_admin' 
          ELSE 'member' 
        END
    WHERE id = user_record.id;
    
    -- Update existing analyses
    UPDATE public.linkedin_analyses
    SET organization_id = new_org_id
    WHERE user_id = user_record.id;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed! The system works with existing Supabase credentials.

### Step 4: Deploy Updated Code
```bash
# Deploy the web app (Vercel/your hosting)
cd apps/sales-curiosity-web
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting provider

# Rebuild Chrome extension
cd apps/sales-curiosity-extension
npm run build
# Upload new version to Chrome Web Store (if needed)
```

### Step 5: Test Organization Features
1. Create a new organization account
2. Verify org admin dashboard loads
3. Try inviting a user (note: email sending not yet implemented)
4. Test integration toggle
5. Generate an email and verify it appears in dashboard
6. Create analysis and verify it appears in dashboard

3. Include invitation link with token
4. Set 7-day expiry (already in DB)
5. Handle expired invitations gracefully
6. Allow re-sending invitations

### When Adding Billing:
1. Use Stripe for payments
2. Store subscription ID in organizations table
3. Enforce seat limits based on plan
4. Show usage warnings before limits
5. Implement grace period for payment failures

### When Implementing SSO:
1. Consider WorkOS or Auth0 for SSO

## üìû Support & Questions

### Common Questions:

**Q: Can individual accounts be upgraded to organization accounts?**
A: Yes! Just need to update the account_type in organizations table and assign org_admin role.

**Q: Can org admins see user passwords?**
A: No! Passwords are managed by Supabase Auth and never exposed.

**Q: What happens if an organization exceeds seat limit?**
A: Currently nothing - enforcement needs to be implemented.

**Q: Can users belong to multiple organizations?**
A: Not currently - one user, one organization. Would need significant changes to support.

**Q: How do I make someone a super_admin?**
A: Update their role in the database:
```sql
UPDATE public.users SET role = 'super_admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```
