# Organization Features - Implementation Summary

## üìã Executive Summary

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive organization account system for the Sales Curiosity Engine. Organizations can now:

- ‚úÖ **Manage Teams** - Create organization accounts with multiple users
- ‚úÖ **Control Access** - Role-based permissions (org_admin, member)
- ‚úÖ **View All Activity** - Admin dashboard showing all analyses and emails
- ‚úÖ **Manage Integrations** - Control which integrations are available to users
- ‚úÖ **Track Usage** - Monitor user activity and context
- ‚úÖ **Invite Users** - Database infrastructure for user invitations
- ‚úÖ **Secure Data** - Multi-tenant architecture with row-level security

---

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Supabase)

**New Tables:**
- `organizations` - Organization details and settings
- `email_generations` - Tracks all AI-generated emails
- `organization_integrations` - Controls integration access
- `user_invitations` - User invitation system
- `audit_logs` - Activity tracking and compliance

**Updated Tables:**
- `users` - Added organization_id, role, user_context
- `linkedin_analyses` - Added organization_id

**Security:**
- Row-level security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Role-based access control

**File:** `supabase-schema-organizations.sql`

### 2. API Layer (Next.js API Routes)

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Handles org account creation
- `POST /api/prospects` - Tracks emails and links to org

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/organization/integrations` - Returns enabled integrations

**Files:**
- `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
- `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/prospects/route.ts`
- `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/organization/integrations/route.ts`

### 3. Frontend Layer (Next.js + React)

**Updated Pages:**
- Signup page with account type selection (Individual vs Organization)

**New Pages:**
- Organization Admin Dashboard (`/admin/organization/page.tsx`)
  - Overview tab with stats
  - Users management tab
  - Analyses viewing tab
  - Email generations tab
  - Integrations control tab

**Features:**
- Beautiful UI matching existing design
- Real-time search and filtering
- User invitation modal
- Integration toggle controls
- Expandable user details

**Files:**
- `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/signup/page.tsx`
- `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/admin/organization/page.tsx`

### 4. Type Definitions (TypeScript)

**New Interfaces:**
- `Organization`
- `LinkedInAnalysis`
- `EmailGeneration`
- `OrganizationIntegration`
- `UserInvitation`
- `AuditLog`

**Updated Interfaces:**
- `User` - Now includes organization_id, role, user_context

**File:** `/apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/types/shared.ts`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Why:** Simpler infrastructure, better performance, cost-effective

**How:**
- Single database with organization_id on all tables
- Row-level security enforces data isolation
- Indexes on organization_id for performance

### Role-Based Access Control
**Roles:**
- `super_admin` - Platform administrators (legacy support)
- `org_admin` - Organization administrators
- `member` - Regular organization users

**Permissions:**
- Super admins: Full access (for platform management)
- Org admins: View/manage all org data, invite users, control integrations
- Members: View own data only

### Data Model
**Key Relationships:**
```
Organization (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) Users
Organization (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) LinkedInAnalyses
Organization (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) EmailGenerations
Organization (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) OrganizationIntegrations
User (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) LinkedInAnalyses
User (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> (Many) EmailGenerations
```
