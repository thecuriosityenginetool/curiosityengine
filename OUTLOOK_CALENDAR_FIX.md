# üìÖ Outlook Calendar Integration - Fix Guide

## üîç Problem

The calendar sync button is not loading events from Outlook. This is because:

1. **New Calendar Scopes Required**: We just added `Calendars.Read` and `Calendars.ReadWrite` scopes to the Outlook OAuth flow
2. **Existing Token Missing Permissions**: Your current Outlook connection token was created BEFORE these scopes were added
3. **Need to Reconnect**: You must disconnect and reconnect Outlook to get the new permissions

## ‚úÖ Solution: Reconnect Outlook

### Step 1: Check Current Connection

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check your Outlook connection status
SELECT 
  id,
  organization_id,
  integration_type,
  is_enabled,
  configuration->>'scope' as current_scopes,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM organization_integrations
WHERE integration_type LIKE 'outlook%'
  AND organization_id = (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM users 
    WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE'  -- Replace with your email
    LIMIT 1
  );
```

### Step 2: Disconnect Outlook (if needed)

If the `current_scopes` field is missing `Calendars.Read` or `Calendars.ReadWrite`, you need to reconnect:

```sql
-- Disconnect Outlook to force reconnection with new scopes
DELETE FROM organization_integrations
WHERE integration_type = 'outlook_user'
  AND organization_id = (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM users 
    WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE'  -- Replace with your email
    LIMIT 1
  );
```

### Step 3: Reconnect Outlook

1. Go to your dashboard: https://www.curiosityengine.io/dashboard
2. Click on **Integrations** tab
3. Click **Connect** next to Microsoft Outlook
4. Grant permissions when prompted (you'll see the calendar scopes listed)
5. After redirect, verify connection shows "Connected ‚úÖ"

### Step 4: Test Calendar Sync

1. Click the **üîÑ Sync** button in the calendar section
2. You should see:
   - Spinner animation while loading
   - Real Outlook events appearing (if you have any)
   - Mock events only if Outlook has no events in the next 14 days

## üîß Expected OAuth Scopes

Your Outlook connection should request these scopes:

- ‚úÖ `openid` - Basic identity
- ‚úÖ `offline_access` - Refresh token
- ‚úÖ `Mail.Send` - Send emails
- ‚úÖ `Mail.ReadWrite` - Read/write emails
- ‚úÖ `User.Read` - Read user profile
- ‚úÖ **`Calendars.Read`** - **NEW: Read calendar events**
- ‚úÖ **`Calendars.ReadWrite`** - **NEW: Create/update calendar events**

## üìä How to Verify It's Working

### Via Console Logs:

Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:

```
üìÖ Fetching calendar events from Outlook...
‚úÖ Fetched X events from Outlook
```

### Via Database:

Check that your token has calendar scopes:

```sql
SELECT 
  (configuration->>'scope')::text as scopes
FROM organization_integrations
WHERE integration_type = 'outlook_user'
  AND organization_id = (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM users 
    WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE'
    LIMIT 1
  );
```

Should include: `Calendars.Read Calendars.ReadWrite`

## üéØ Testing Email Drafts

Once Outlook is reconnected with full permissions, test:

### Via AI Chat:

1. **Create Email Draft:**
   ```
   Create an email draft to john@example.com about our meeting tomorrow
   ```

2. **Create Calendar Event:**
   ```
   Create a meeting with Jane at 2pm tomorrow for 1 hour
   ```

3. **Sync Calendar:**
   Click the üîÑ Sync button to refresh events

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Calendar Still Shows Mock Data

**Check:**
1. Outlook is connected (Integrations tab shows ‚úÖ)
2. Browser console shows "Fetching calendar events from Outlook..."
3. No 401 errors in Network tab (would indicate token expired)

**Fix:**
- Disconnect and reconnect Outlook
- Check you have events in your Outlook calendar for the next 14 days

### 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Cause:** Token expired or invalid

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Force token refresh by deleting current connection
DELETE FROM organization_integrations
WHERE integration_type = 'outlook_user';
```

Then reconnect via dashboard.

### No Events Show Up

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Your Outlook calendar is empty for next 14 days ‚Üí Expected behavior (will show mock data)
2. Calendar permissions not granted ‚Üí Reconnect Outlook
3. Different calendar selected ‚Üí Microsoft Graph API uses primary calendar by default

## üìù Summary

**Required Action:** Disconnect and reconnect Microsoft Outlook to get calendar permissions

**Expected Result:** Calendar sync button loads real Outlook events

**No Supabase Changes Needed:** All database tables are already configured correctly
