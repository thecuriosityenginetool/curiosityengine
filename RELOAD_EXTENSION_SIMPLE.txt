CHROME EXTENSION - SIMPLE RELOAD STEPS
===========================================

Your extension is showing the OLD ICON which means it wasn't reloaded properly.

FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

1. Go to: chrome://extensions/

2. Find "Sales Curiosity" and click REMOVE (red button)

3. Close Chrome COMPLETELY (Cmd+Q on Mac, not just the window)

4. Wait 10 seconds

5. Open Chrome again

6. Go to: chrome://extensions/

7. Turn ON "Developer mode" (top right toggle)

8. Click "Load unpacked"

9. Navigate to and SELECT this EXACT folder:
   /Users/matthewbravo/Downloads/curiosityengine-2/apps/sales-curiosity-extension/dist

10. You should now see:
    - Orange flame icon ðŸ”¥ (NOT black icon)
    - Version 1.0.0
    - ID: will be different (that's normal)

11. Close ALL LinkedIn tabs

12. Open a NEW LinkedIn profile page

13. Let it fully load, scroll down

14. Click extension icon

15. Click "Analyze Profile"

16. Open browser console (F12) and look for:
    "âœ… Sales Curiosity content script loaded"

If you see the OLD BLACK ICON still, you didn't reload correctly.
Repeat steps 1-9.

The extension IS built correctly.
The icons ARE updated.
You just need to reload it properly!
