# Root Cause Analysis - Why Auth Is Hanging

## üîç Tracing the Hang

### What We Know:
1. Login succeeds (creates Supabase session)
2. Console shows "üîç Org dashboard: Checking auth..."
3. Then it hangs for 8+ seconds
4. Times out with alert

### Where It's Hanging:

Looking at org dashboard `checkAuth()`:
```typescript
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession(); // ‚Üê Probably here?

// OR

const response = await fetch('/api/user/role', { // ‚Üê Or here?
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}` }
});
```

### Most Likely Cause:

**`/api/user/role` endpoint is hanging or slow**

Why? Let me check that endpoint...

The endpoint does:
1. Gets user from auth token
2. Queries `users` table for role
3. Queries `organizations` table for org info

**THE PROBLEM:** Those queries are ALSO subject to RLS!

The endpoint uses service role key, but if there's an error in the query or the data doesn't exist, it could hang.

## üéØ THE REAL FIX

We need to make `/api/user/role` FAST and RELIABLE.

Currently it's:
- Doing database queries
- Subject to database performance
- Can fail or timeout

**Better approach:**
Store user role and org info in the JWT token metadata, then we can read it instantly without any database calls!

But that requires changing signup...

## üí° IMMEDIATE ACTION

Given how deep we are in auth issues after a full day of work, I recommend:

**Option A: Simplify Everything (30 min)**
- Remove all the complex routing
- Make login go to ONE place for everyone
- Load role-specific features on that page
- No redirects based on role

**Option B: Debug Step by Step (Now)**
- Add console.log at EVERY step of checkAuth
- Find exact line where it hangs
- Fix that specific issue

**Option C: Take a Break (Recommended)**
- We've been debugging for hours
- Diminishing returns
- Fresh eyes tomorrow will see issues we're missing

Which do you want to do?

For now, let me add detailed logging to find the EXACT hang point...
