# ✅ Salesforce AI Chat Integration - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Salesforce CRM AI chat system with streaming responses, intelligent tool calling, and calendar-CRM matching. The AI can now search, create, update CRM records, add notes, create tasks, and match calendar events to Salesforce contacts/leads - all through natural conversation.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Bug Fixes ✅

1. **Fixed Missing State Variable**
   - Added `cardMousePositions` state to dashboard
   - Resolved JavaScript error: `setCardMousePositions is not defined`
   - File: `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (line 97)

### Phase 2: Salesforce AI Chat Integration ✅

#### 1. Enhanced Salesforce Library
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/salesforce.ts`

Added 5 new functions for complete CRM operations:
- ✅ `updateSalesforceContact()` - Update existing contact fields
- ✅ `updateSalesforceLead()` - Update existing lead fields  
- ✅ `getRecentActivity()` - Get tasks, events, notes for a record
- ✅ `createSalesforceTask()` - Create task/reminder on a contact/lead
- ✅ `querySalesforce()` - Execute flexible SOQL queries

#### 2. OpenAI Tool Definitions
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/salesforce-tools.ts` (NEW)

Created 8 AI tools with complete schemas:
- 🔍 `search_salesforce` - Search contacts/leads by name, email, company
- ✏️ `create_lead` - Create new lead from chat
- ✏️ `create_contact` - Create new contact from chat
- 📝 `update_record` - Update contact/lead fields
- 📌 `add_note` - Add note to a record
- ✅ `create_task` - Create task/reminder
- 📊 `get_activity` - Get recent interactions
- 🔎 `query_crm` - Execute flexible SOQL query

#### 3. Calendar-Salesforce Matcher
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/calendar-matcher.ts` (NEW)

Smart matching system that:
- Extracts attendee emails from calendar events
- Searches Salesforce for matching contacts/leads
- Enriches events with CRM context (name, title, company, last contact date)
- Caches matches for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- Formats enriched context for AI consumption

#### 4. Streaming Chat API with Tool Calling
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (COMPLETE REWRITE)

Major changes:
- ✅ Switched from `gpt-5-mini` responses API to `gpt-4o` chat completions
- ✅ Added Salesforce tool definitions to completion request
- ✅ Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- ✅ Tool call execution mid-stream (pause, execute, resume)
- ✅ Calendar event matching with Salesforce integration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

#### 5. Streaming Dashboard UI
**File:** `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

Updated `sendChatMessage()` function:
- ✅ Processes streaming responses with ReadableStream
- ✅ Real-time content updates as AI generates response
- ✅ Tool execution indicators with icons:
  - 🔍 Searching Salesforce
  - ✏️ Creating lead/contact
  - 📝 Updating record
  - ✅ Creating task
  - 📊 Getting activity
  - 📌 Adding note
- ✅ Clean error handling with user-friendly messages

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Model Selection
- **GPT-4o** for chat orchestration and tool calling (reliable function calling)
- Can optionally use **GPT-4o-mini** for simple parsing tasks if needed

### Streaming Implementation
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) format: `data: {JSON}\n\n`
- Event types:
  - `content` - Text content chunk
  - `tool_start` - Tool execution begins
  - `tool_executing` - Tool is running
  - `tool_result` - Tool completed
  - `done` - Stream finished
  - `error` - Error occurred

### Matching Strategy
1. **Email (exact)** - Primary matching key
2. **Name + Company (fuzzy)** - Secondary matching
3. **LinkedIn URL (exact)** - Tertiary matching
4. **5-minute cache** - Reduces redundant API calls

## ⚠️ Remaining Items (User Action Required)

### Phase 1 Items (Database/Infrastructure)
These need to be checked/fixed by you:

1. **Verify Database Tables**
   - Check that `activity_logs`, `chats`, `chat_messages` tables exist
   - Run SQL migration files if missing (see `supabase-add-*.sql` files)

2. **Fix RLS Policies** (if API calls are failing)
   - Review RLS policies for `users`, `activity_logs`, `chats` tables
   - Ensure service role has full access
   - See `fix-rls-properly.sql` or `BUDDY_TEST_FIXES_NEEDED.md`

3. **Test API Endpoints**
   - Verify `/api/chat` returns streaming responses
   - Verify `/api/calendar` returns events
   - Verify `/api/activity-logs` works
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Verify Vercel build succeeds
   - Check that all environment variables are set:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`
     - `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once deployed, test these scenarios:

### Basic CRM Operations
- [ ] Search for existing contact: "Who is [name]?"
- [ ] Create new lead: "Create a lead for Jane Doe at Acme Corp"
- [ ] Create new contact: "Add John Smith as a contact"
- [ ] Update record: "Update Jane's email to jane@newcompany.com"
- [ ] Add note: "Add a note to John about our meeting"
- [ ] Create task: "Remind me to follow up with Jane in 3 days"
- [ ] Get activity: "What's my recent activity with John?"

## 💡 Tips for Usage

### For Best Results:
1. **Be specific**: "Search for John Smith at Acme Corp" vs "Find John"
2. **Use natural language**: The AI understands intent, not keywords
3. **Provide context**: "Create a lead for the CMO I met at the conference"
4. **Ask follow-ups**: "Now add a note about our call" (AI remembers context)

### Common Patterns:
- **Search first**: "Who is John Smith?" then "Add a note to his record"
- **Context awareness**: AI will remember Record IDs from previous searches
- **Calendar queries**: "Who am I meeting with tomorrow?" (auto-matches CRM)
- **Batch requests**: "Create leads for Jane Doe at TechStart and Bob Jones at SalesCo"

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Tool Calling Flow
```
User sends message
    ↓
AI receives message + tools list
    ↓
AI decides to call tool (e.g., search_salesforce)
    ↓
Backend executes Salesforce API call
    ↓
Result returned to AI
    ↓
AI generates natural language response
    ↓
Stream to user with indicators
```

### Calendar Matching Flow
```
User asks about calendar
    ↓
Load calendar events
    ↓
Extract attendee emails
    ↓
Check cache (5min TTL)
    ↓
Search Salesforce for each email
    ↓
Enrich events with CRM data
    ↓
Build context string
    ↓
AI receives enriched calendar
    ↓
AI responds with CRM insights
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Key format**: `{orgId}:{email}` or `{orgId}:company:{name}`
- **Storage**: In-memory Map (resets on server restart)
- **Purpose**: Reduce redundant Salesforce API calls during active conversations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Salesforce CRM is not connected"
**Solution:** Check that Salesforce integration is enabled:
1. Dashboard → Settings → Integrations
2. Connect Salesforce
3. Verify connection in database: `organization_integrations` table

### Issue: Tool calls fail with "Invalid token"
**Solution:** Verify Salesforce tokens are valid:
1. Check `organization_integrations` table has valid tokens
2. Tokens may have expired (refresh flow should handle this)
3. Re-connect Salesforce integration

### Issue: Calendar events don't show CRM matches
**Solutions:**
1. Verify Salesforce is connected
2. Check that calendar events have attendee emails
3. Ensure attendees exist in Salesforce
4. Check browser console for matching errors

### Issue: Streaming response is slow or broken
**Solutions:**
1. Check OpenAI API key is valid
2. Verify network connection to OpenAI
3. Check browser console for SSE parsing errors
4. Ensure `Content-Type: text/event-stream` header is present
