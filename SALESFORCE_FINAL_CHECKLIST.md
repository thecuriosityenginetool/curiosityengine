## 🚨 CRITICAL: Before Testing

### **1. Add Callback URL in Salesforce**

You MUST add this callback URL to your Salesforce Connected App:

```
https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/salesforce/callback
```

**How to add it:**
1. Go back to Salesforce Setup
2. External Client Apps → Sales Curiosity Engine → Settings
3. Find "Callback URL" or "Redirect URI"
4. Add: `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/salesforce/callback`
5. **Make sure it matches EXACTLY** with your `SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI` env var
6. Save

### **2. Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**

Check these are set:
- ✅ `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID` = Your Consumer Key
- ✅ `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET` = Your Consumer Secret
- ✅ `SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI` = `https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/salesforce/callback`

### **3. Also Verify These Existing Vars:**
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = Your Vercel URL
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = Your Supabase URL
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = Your service role key
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` = Your OpenAI key
