## üéØ How It Works for Users

### User Experience:

1. **User opens Chrome extension**
2. **Goes to Settings ‚Üí Integrations tab**
3. **Clicks "Connect Salesforce"**
4. **Logs in with THEIR Salesforce credentials** (not yours!)
5. **Grants permissions**
6. **Done! Status shows "Connected"**

### Behind the Scenes:

```
User clicks "Connect Salesforce"
          ‚Üì
Extension calls: GET /api/salesforce/auth-user
   (with user's auth token)
          ‚Üì
Backend generates Salesforce OAuth URL with state token
          ‚Üì
Returns: { ok: true, authUrl: "https://login.salesforce.com/..." }
          ‚Üì
Extension opens URL in new tab
          ‚Üì
User logs in to THEIR Salesforce account
          ‚Üì
Salesforce redirects to: /api/salesforce/user-callback?code=xxx&state=yyy
          ‚Üì
Backend validates state token
Backend exchanges code for access_token + refresh_token
Backend gets user's Salesforce instance URL
          ‚Üì
Backend saves to organization_integrations table:
{
  user_id: "user-uuid",
  organization_id: "org-uuid",
  integration_type: "salesforce_user",
  is_enabled: true,
  configuration: {
    access_token: "xxx",
    refresh_token: "yyy",
    instance_url: "https://yourinstance.salesforce.com",
    id: "...",
    issued_at: "...",
    signature: "..."
  }
}
          ‚Üì
User redirected back with success message
          ‚Üì
Extension refreshes and shows "Connected" ‚úÖ
```

### When User Drafts Email:

```
User on LinkedIn profile: John Smith (john@acme.com)
          ‚Üì
User clicks "Generate Email" in extension
          ‚Üì
Extension calls: POST /api/prospects with LinkedIn data
          ‚Üì
Backend calls: searchPersonInSalesforce(userId, orgId, email, name)
          ‚Üì
Salesforce REST API call: Query Contacts WHERE Email = 'john@acme.com'
          ‚Üì
IF FOUND:
  - Returns: { found: true, type: 'Contact', data: {...}, lastInteractionDate: '2024-01-15' }
  - AI prompt: "This person exists in user's CRM as Contact. Last interaction: 2 months ago. Write a follow-up email referencing existing relationship."
  - Email response shows: "üîó Salesforce Status: Found as Contact in your CRM"
          ‚Üì
IF NOT FOUND:
  - Returns: { found: false, type: null, data: null }
  - AI prompt: "This is a new prospect not in CRM. Write first-contact cold outreach email."
  - Backend calls: createSalesforceContact() with LinkedIn data
  - New Contact created in Salesforce with email, name, title, company, LinkedIn URL
  - Email response shows: "‚ûï Salesforce Status: New contact added to your CRM"
          ‚Üì
User receives perfectly tailored email + CRM stays in sync!
