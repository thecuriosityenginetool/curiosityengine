In `apps/sales-curiosity-web/.env.local`:

```bash
# Salesforce OAuth
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
SALESFORCE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/salesforce/user-callback

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# ... etc
```

### Run locally:

```bash
cd apps/sales-curiosity-web
npm run dev
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Part 5: Testing the Integration (5 minutes)

### Test 1: Connect Salesforce from Web App

1. Go to your deployed app: `https://www.curiosityengine.io`
2. Log in as a user
3. Go to **Settings** or **Integrations** page
4. Find **Salesforce** section
5. Click **"Connect Salesforce"**
6. You should be redirected to Salesforce login
7. Log in with any Salesforce account
8. Click **Allow** to grant permissions
9. You should be redirected back with success message
10. Salesforce should now show as "Connected" ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Connect from Chrome Extension

1. Open your Chrome extension
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Find **Salesforce** card
4. Click **"Connect Salesforce"**
5. New tab opens with Salesforce OAuth
6. Log in and authorize
7. Close the tab
8. Extension should show "Salesforce Connected" ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Use in Real Scenario

1. Go to a LinkedIn profile
2. Click your extension icon
3. Click **"Generate Email"** (or similar)
4. **Behind the scenes:**
   - Extension checks if this person exists in your Salesforce
   - If found ‚Üí AI generates "follow-up" style email
   - If not found ‚Üí AI generates "cold outreach" email + auto-creates contact
5. You'll see Salesforce status in the response

---

## Part 6: Database Schema (Already Done!)

‚úÖ Your database already has the required schema in the `organization_integrations` table.

The integration stores:
- `access_token` - OAuth access token
- `refresh_token` - For automatic token refresh
- `instance_url` - User's Salesforce instance URL
- `user_id` - Which user connected this account

**No additional database setup needed!**

---

## üéØ How It Works for Users

### User Flow:

1. **User clicks "Connect Salesforce"** (in web app or extension)
   ‚Üì
2. **Redirected to Salesforce login**
   - User logs in with THEIR Salesforce credentials
   - User grants permissions to Sales Curiosity Engine
   ‚Üì
3. **OAuth callback saves tokens** to database
   - Tokens are encrypted and stored per-user
   - Refresh token allows automatic renewal
   ‚Üì
4. **User's Salesforce is now connected!**
   - They can search their CRM
   - Auto-create contacts in their Salesforce
   - AI tailors emails based on their CRM data

### Technical Flow:

```
Extension/Web App
      ‚Üì
GET /api/salesforce/auth-user (authenticated)
      ‚Üì
Returns: { authUrl: "https://login.salesforce.com/..." }
      ‚Üì
User logs into their Salesforce
      ‚Üì
Salesforce redirects to: /api/salesforce/user-callback?code=xxx
      ‚Üì
Backend exchanges code for tokens
      ‚Üì
Tokens saved to organization_integrations table
      ‚Üì
User sees "Connected" status
```

When user drafts email:

```
User generates email for LinkedIn profile
      ‚Üì
POST /api/prospects (with LinkedIn data)
      ‚Üì
Backend calls searchPersonInSalesforce(userId, organizationId, email, name)
      ‚Üì
Searches user's Salesforce: Contacts ‚Üí Leads
      ‚Üì
If FOUND: AI prompt includes "this is a follow-up"
If NOT FOUND: AI prompt says "this is first contact" + createSalesforceContact()
      ‚Üì
AI generates contextually appropriate email
      ‚Üì
User gets perfect email + CRM stays synced
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

‚úÖ **Each user connects their own Salesforce**
- OAuth tokens are stored per-user
- Users can disconnect anytime
- No shared credentials

‚úÖ **Secure token storage**
- Tokens encrypted in Supabase
- Automatic token refresh
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

‚úÖ **Minimal permissions**
- Only requests necessary OAuth scopes
- Read/write to Contacts and Leads only
- No admin access required

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to initiate OAuth flow"

**Fix:**
- Check Vercel environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID` is present
- Redeploy after adding env vars

### Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Fix:**
1. Go to Salesforce Setup ‚Üí App Manager
2. Edit your Connected App
3. Verify callback URL matches EXACTLY:
   - `https://www.curiosityengine.io/api/salesforce/user-callback`
   - NO trailing slash
   - NO extra parameters
4. Save and try again

### Issue: "Invalid client credentials"

**Fix:**
- Double-check `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET` is correct
- Make sure you copied the entire secret (no spaces)
- Try regenerating the secret in Salesforce

### Issue: "User not found in Salesforce"

**Possible reasons:**
- Email doesn't match exactly (check spelling)
- Person is using a different email in Salesforce
- Search is case-sensitive for names

**The integration will auto-create them on first email draft!**

### Issue: "Token expired"

**Fix:**
- The system should auto-refresh tokens
- If it fails, user needs to disconnect and reconnect
- Check refresh token is being stored correctly

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### Check if integration is working:

**In Supabase:**
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Open `organization_integrations` table
3. Look for rows where `integration_type = 'salesforce_user'`
4. `is_enabled` should be `true`
5. `configuration` should contain tokens

**In Vercel:**
1. Go to your project
2. Click **Logs** tab
3. Filter for: `salesforce`
4. Look for successful OAuth callbacks

**In Application:**
- Users see "Connected" badge
- Extension shows Salesforce status
- Email drafts include CRM context

## üöÄ Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. **Announce to users** that Salesforce integration is available
2. **Create a help doc** showing users how to connect their Salesforce
3. **Monitor usage** to see how many users connect
4. **Gather feedback** on CRM matching accuracy
5. **Consider adding more features:**
   - Sync LinkedIn activities to Salesforce as tasks
   - Update existing contact info from LinkedIn
   - Search Salesforce accounts (companies)
   - Create opportunities from prospects

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Multiple Salesforce Orgs:** Each user can only connect one Salesforce account at a time

2. **Salesforce Sandboxes:** To use a Salesforce Sandbox instead of production:
   - Change OAuth URL from `https://login.salesforce.com` to `https://test.salesforce.com`
   - Update in `apps/sales-curiosity-web/src/lib/salesforce.ts` line 78

3. **Custom Fields:** If your Salesforce has custom fields you want to populate:
   - Edit `createSalesforceContact()` function in `salesforce.ts`
   - Add custom field mappings

4. **Rate Limits:** Salesforce has API rate limits
   - Developer Edition: 5,000 API calls per 24 hours
   - Consider caching search results

5. **Lead vs Contact:** The integration creates Contacts by default
   - To create Leads instead, modify the `createSalesforceContact` call
   - Or add logic to choose based on company size/type
