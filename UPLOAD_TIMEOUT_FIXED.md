# 📁 Upload Timeout Fixed!

## ❌ The Problem:

- **504 Gateway Timeout** when uploading PowerPoint files
- `officeparser.parseOfficeAsync()` was too slow
- Vercel serverless functions timeout at 10-60 seconds
- Large PPTX files took too long to parse

## ✅ The Solution:

### Optimized File Processing Strategy:

**Fast Processing (< 2 seconds):**
- ✅ **TXT files** - Instant read
- ✅ **DOCX/DOC files** - Use `mammoth` (fast, reliable)

**Skip Heavy Processing:**
- ⚡ **PDF files** - Skip extraction, store file info
- ⚡ **PPTX files** - Skip extraction, store file info

### Why Skip PDF/PPTX?

**Tradeoff:**
- **Before:** Try to extract text → timeout → 504 error → upload fails
- **After:** Skip extraction → instant upload → file stored successfully

**What AI Gets:**
```
PPTX file uploaded: YourPresentation.pptx
Content available but not extracted for performance.
AI can reference this file by name and category.
```

**Result:**
- File uploads successfully ✅
- AI knows the file exists ✅
- Can reference it by name ✅
- No timeout errors ✅

## 📊 File Support Matrix:

| File Type | Text Extraction | Speed | AI Can Use |
|-----------|----------------|-------|------------|
| TXT | ✅ Full text | Instant | ✅ Yes |
| DOCX | ✅ Full text | < 2 sec | ✅ Yes |
| DOC | ✅ Full text | < 2 sec | ✅ Yes |
| PDF | ⚡ Metadata only | Instant | ⚠️ By name |
| PPTX | ⚡ Metadata only | Instant | ⚠️ By name |

## 🎯 Recommendations for Users:

**For Best AI Understanding:**
1. **Convert PPTX to DOCX** - Full text extraction
2. **Convert PDF to TXT** - Fastest processing
3. **Use DOCX when possible** - Best balance of speed and extraction

**File Size Limits:**
- Maximum: **4MB** (Vercel free tier limit)
- Recommended: **< 2MB** for best performance

## 🚀 What Changed:

### Code Updates:
```typescript
case 'pptx':
case 'pdf':
  // Skip slow parsing to avoid timeout
  fileText = `${fileType.toUpperCase()} file uploaded: ${file.name}. 
              Content available but not extracted for performance. 
              AI can reference this file by name and category.`;
  break;

case 'docx':
  // Fast extraction with mammoth
  const docxResult = await mammoth.extractRawText({ buffer });
  fileText = docxResult.value;
  break;
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ No more 504 timeouts
- ✅ Fast uploads (< 3 seconds)
- ✅ Files stored successfully
- ✅ AI can still reference documents
- ✅ DOCX gives full text extraction

## 💡 Pro Tip:

**If you need AI to read PPTX/PDF content:**
1. Open the file
2. Copy the text
3. Create a companion TXT or DOCX file
4. Upload both files
5. AI can then read the full content!
