## üí° Smart UX Decisions

### 1. Integration Display Logic
**Problem:** Should org members see "Connect" buttons they can't use?

- **Org Admin:** Shows link to dashboard (where they actually manage it)
- **Org Member:** Shows status only (transparent but not confusing)

### 2. Stats Display
**Problem:** What stats are relevant to each user?
**Solution:**
- **Individual:** Personal stats only (their work matters)
- **Org Admin:** Personal + Team (needs oversight)
- **Org Member:** Personal only (focus on contribution)

### 3. Badge Hierarchy
**Problem:** How to show role at a glance?
**Solution:**
- **Color Coding:** Cyan (personal), Purple (org), Red (admin), Gray (member)
- **Emoji Icons:** üë§ (solo), üè¢ (team)
- **Text Badges:** Clear role labels

### 4. Access Control
**Problem:** How to prevent unauthorized access?
**Solution:**
- **Database RLS:** Automatic data filtering
- **Route Protection:** Auth checks on admin pages
- **UI Hiding:** Don't show features users can't use
- **Clear Messaging:** Tell users who controls what
