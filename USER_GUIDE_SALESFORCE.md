## Example: Tailored Email Generation

### Scenario 1: Person Already in Your CRM

**LinkedIn Profile:** John Smith, VP of Sales at Acme Corp

**AI checks Salesforce:** ‚úÖ Found as Contact (last interaction: 2 months ago)

**Generated Email:**
> Hi John,
>
> I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation from a few months ago about improving your sales team's outreach efficiency.
>
> I noticed you're still at Acme Corp ‚Äî congrats on the continued success there! I'd love to reconnect and share some updates on what we've been working on...

### Scenario 2: New Person (Not in CRM)

**LinkedIn Profile:** Sarah Johnson, Marketing Director at Tech Startup

**AI checks Salesforce:** ‚ùå Not found

**What happens:**
1. AI generates cold outreach email
2. Sarah is automatically added to your Salesforce as a Contact
3. LinkedIn URL and context are saved

**Generated Email:**
> Hi Sarah,
>
> I came across your profile and was impressed by your work at Tech Startup. As a Marketing Director, I imagine you're always looking for ways to improve your team's outreach and engagement strategies.
