# üîç What's Happening - Status Update

## The Situation

You're experiencing the login not persisting because of a **deployment timing issue**.

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. Extension OAuth login ‚úÖ
2. Token is being saved to chrome.storage ‚úÖ  
3. Extension is finding the token ‚úÖ
4. New branding is working ‚úÖ

### What's NOT Working ‚ùå
- API rejects the extension token (401 error)
- Extension clears storage when API says 401
- You have to log in again every time

### Why It's Happening ü§î

**The fix is in the code but Vercel hasn't deployed it yet!**

**Timeline:**
- ‚úÖ **20 min ago:** I fixed the API to accept extension tokens
- ‚úÖ **15 min ago:** Pushed to GitHub (commit `8ed8bfe`)
- ‚è≥ **Now:** Vercel is still deploying OR deployment failed
- ‚ùå **Current:** API still using old code (rejects extension tokens)

---

## üîß Immediate Solution: Check Vercel

### Option 1: Check if Deployment Succeeded

Go to Vercel and check:
1. Is the latest deployment (`8ed8bfe` - "Fix extension token validation") successful?
2. If YES ‚Üí Test should work now
3. If NO ‚Üí Deployment failed, need to fix
4. If BUILDING ‚Üí Wait for it to complete

### Option 2: Test if API Fix is Live

Open browser console on any page and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://www.curiosityengine.io/api/user/stats', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer test'
  }
}).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log);
```

If it shows error about "extension token" or tries to decode base64, the fix is live.
If it just says "Unauthorized - Invalid token", old code is still running.

## üöÄ Two Paths Forward:

### Path A: Wait for Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Check Vercel deployment status**
2. **Wait if it's still building** (2-3 min)
3. **If deployment failed,** let me know what the error is
4. **Once deployed,** reload extension and test

### Path B: Temporary Workaround (Test Now)

Skip the API validation temporarily so you can test Salesforce:

**I can update the extension to NOT validate the token immediately** - just trust it exists and show the dashboard. This lets you test Salesforce while waiting for Vercel.

Want me to do the temporary workaround so you can continue testing?

## üìä Current Status

### Extension:
- ‚úÖ Built and ready
- ‚úÖ OAuth working
- ‚úÖ Token saving working
- ‚úÖ New branding
- ‚è≥ **Waiting for:** API deployment

### API:
- ‚úÖ Code fixed (in GitHub)
- ‚è≥ **Waiting for:** Vercel deployment
- ‚ùå **Current:** Still using old code

### What You Can Do:
1. **Check Vercel** - See if deployment succeeded
2. **Wait 2-3 min** - If still building
3. **Tell me if deployment failed** - I'll fix it
4. **Or:** Let me add temporary workaround to test now

**Which do you want to do?**
- A) Check Vercel status and wait for deployment
- B) Add temporary workaround to test Salesforce now
